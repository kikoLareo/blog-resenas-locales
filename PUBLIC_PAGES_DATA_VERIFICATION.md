## CONCLUSION

This Next.js blog application **uses 100% real data from Sanity CMS** for all public-facing pages. There is:

1. **No mock data imports** - All previously hardcoded mock data has been removed
2. **No hardcoded example data** - Content is stored and fetched from Sanity
3. **No test datasets** - Queries filter by publication status and actual Sanity documents
4. **Proper error handling** - Graceful fallbacks for connection issues
5. **Efficient caching** - ISR with configurable revalidation periods

All data transformations happen at the query level (GROQ) or during rendering, ensuring data accuracy and consistency with the Sanity source.
