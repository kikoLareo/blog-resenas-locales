# Performance Dashboard - Quick Start Guide 🚀

## ✅ What's Been Done

The Performance Dashboard is **fully implemented and verified**. Here's what works:

### 📊 Dashboard Features
- **URL**: `/dashboard/performance`
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FCP, CLS, TTFB, INP
- **Statistics**: P50, P75, P90, P95 percentiles
- **Bundle Analysis**: File sizes, optimization recommendations
- **Timeframes**: 1h, 6h, 24h, 7 days
- **Device Info**: Memory, CPU, connection type

### 🔧 Implementation Details
- ✅ Official `web-vitals` library installed
- ✅ Auto-tracking on all pages (via root layout)
- ✅ API endpoints for metrics and bundle analysis
- ✅ Unit tests (4 tests passing)
- ✅ Security scan (0 vulnerabilities)
- ✅ Documentation complete

## 🎯 Quick Usage

### 1. View the Dashboard
```bash
# In browser, navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/performance
```

### 2. Test Metrics Collection
1. Visit a few pages on your site
2. Wait 1-2 minutes
3. Go to `/dashboard/performance`
4. You should see metrics data

### 3. View Bundle Analysis
```bash
# Build the app first
npm run build

# Then view the dashboard
# Bundle analysis will show file sizes
```

## 🌐 Environment Variables

### Enable/Disable Tracking
```bash
# .env or .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_TRACKING=true  # default
```

Set to `false` to disable tracking in development or for privacy.

## ⚠️ Important Limitation

### In-Memory Storage
The current implementation stores metrics **in memory**, which means:
- ✅ Works great for development and testing
- ✅ No external dependencies needed
- ❌ Data is lost when server restarts
- ❌ Not suitable for production serverless environments

### For Production Use
Consider migrating to persistent storage. See `PERFORMANCE_DASHBOARD_VERIFICATION.md` for:
- Vercel KV setup
- Upstash Redis setup  
- PostgreSQL/Prisma setup

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test tests/unit/components/PerformanceMonitor.test.tsx
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
# 3. Navigate to any page
# 4. Look for POST to /api/performance/metrics
# 5. Check dashboard at /dashboard/performance
```
